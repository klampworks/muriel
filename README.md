Experiments with Unixy rootkits

This was originally a repository for me to play around with the concets and ideas presented the fantastic book [Designing BSD Rootkits](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-BSD-Rootkits-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593271425/).

Since the book targets FreeBSD 6.0, that's the platform I have started with.

My extending the code and porting to more platforms I hope to learn a bit about how different operating systems work on the inside and be able to compare different kernels on a deeper level.
